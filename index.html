                  <dd>A dog-like demon who is the title character. He is a pervert who gets never-ending enjoyment in sexually harassing others, especially Sakuma. He is also deathly afraid of Akutabe, who tends to abuse him when he gets out of line or fails to accomplish a goal. His ability is called <em>Lewdness</em>, which gives him the ability to incite lust. His powers range from making people attractive, unattractive, and even cause impotence. When Akutabe ended their contract, he became contracted with Sakuma much to her chagrin.</dd>
                  <dd>He represents 'Lust' of the seven deadly sins.</dd>

                  <dd>Rinko Sakuma is the young female assistant of Akutabe. Young and naive, she is just starting to learn about the power of demons. She is bound in a contract with Azazel. She appears to be one of the more moral people in the series early on, but as she learns more about demons, she becomes considerably darker. Many of the demons note she is becoming more like Akutabe. She is also easily influenced by money. Azazel's nickname for her is Saku-chan (<span lang="ja">サクちゃん</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets" title="Help:Installing Japanese character sets">?</a>).</dd>

                  <dd>Akutabe is a detective that specializes in using demons. He is very knowledgeable in the occult, and uses this knowledge to overpower the demons, even enabling him to block a powered up <em>Divulgence</em> spell from Beelzebub. He is Sakuma's employer as well as a mentor. He will summon demons to do his bidding and will often mistreat them if they annoy him or mess up their assignments. He has shown to be cruel and rather sadistic causing even demons to be afraid of him.</dd>

Despite appearing to be a bird, he is actually a fly demon who eats feces much to the disgust of those around him. He also has an ability called <em>Divulgence</em> which gives him the power to make others reveal their hidden selves ranging from revealing the side of them they don't want people to see, to forced defecation. He can also use goat dung as a doping drug, making his attacks considerably more powerful.

                  <dd>Salamander is a red lizard like demon who was originally summoned by an amateur for personal, selfish reasons.

He always carries a Katana that is strapped to his waist. Azazel's nickname for him is Manda-han (<span lang="ja">マンダはん</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets" title="Help:Installing Japanese character sets">?</a>).</dd>

According to Azazel and Beelzebub, he is the most violent demon in Hell and both are evidently scared of him, especially when he is angered. Akutabe praises him as a demon on a higher league than his other demons and explained that he has the ability called <em>Violence</em> though what it does is unknown. He was apparently killed when Sariel took his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimoire" title="Grimoire">grimoire</a> to heaven. His nickname is Mossan (<span lang="ja">モッさん</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets" title="Help:Installing Japanese character sets">?</a>).</dd>

                  <dd>An angel sent to collect grimoires of demons. Due to a strict law imposed on angels, he cannot help mortals in need despite his righteous nature and can only act as an observer. Also of note is that they cannot help even themselves if a human is the one tormenting them. The only time angels are permitted to help humans is if a demon is involved, in which case they will take its grimoire back to heaven. He steals Moloch's grimoire and takes it to heaven, killing the latter in the process.</dd>
